# MultiplayerAPI for Balatro

A mod library that adds real-time multiplayer to [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/). Provides lobby management, player state sync, actions, chat, and player authentication with Steam and Discord.

## API

All functions are accessed through the global `MPAPI` table.

`create_lobby` and `join_lobby` are async, they talk to the API server to get credentials, then connect to the broker. Use the `on("connected")` event to know when the lobby is ready.

By default, lobbies connect to the official MultiplayerAPI server. Self-hosted servers can be configured via the mod config (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### Lobby

```lua
-- Create a new lobby for your mod. Returns a lobby object.
-- Generates a short join code, authenticates with the server,
-- and connects to the broker.
local lobby = MPAPI.create_lobby("my_mod_id")

-- Join an existing lobby by code.
local lobby = MPAPI.join_lobby("my_mod_id", "GWLPR")

-- Leave the current lobby. Cleans up connections.
lobby:leave()

-- Lobby info
lobby.code        -- "GWLPR"
lobby.mod_id      -- "my_mod_id"
lobby.is_host     -- true/false
lobby.player_id   -- this player's ID
```

### Lobby Metadata

Host-controlled data that describes the lobby. Persists for the lifetime of the lobby and new joiners receive it immediately. Only the host can set metadata (enforced server-side).

```lua
-- Host sets metadata (table, merged with existing)
lobby:set_metadata({ max_players = 4, ante = 1, stake = "gold", deck = "black" })

-- Any player reads metadata
local meta = lobby:get_metadata()
-- { host = "player_123", max_players = 4, ante = 1, difficulty = "gold" }
```

### Player State

Each player publishes their own state. Player state is **private** — players can only read and write their own state (enforced server-side). Any information another player needs should be communicated via [Actions](#actions).

```lua
-- Set your own state (table, replaces previous)
lobby:set_player_state({ score = 1250, hands_left = 3, location = "selecting_blind" })

-- Read your own last known state (e.g. after reconnect)
local state = lobby:get_player_state(self.player_id)

-- Get all players in the lobby
local players = lobby:get_players()
-- { { id = "player_123" }, { id = "player_456" } }
```

### Actions

Actions are the core way mods communicate game-specific events. You define an **action type** with a parameter schema and receive handler, then create **action instances** to send them. Actions support request/response, the receiver can return data that the sender gets via a callback.

#### Defining an Action Type

```lua
my_mod.actions.swap_joker = MPAPI.ActionType({
    -- Unique key for this action
    key = "swap_joker",

    -- Parameters the sender must include (validated before sending)
    parameters = {
        { key = "joker", type = "string", required = true },
    },

    -- Parameters expected in the response (if the receiver responds)
    response_parameters = {
        { key = "joker", type = "string" },
    },

    -- Called when this action is received from another player.
    -- Return a table to send a response, or true to just acknowledge.
    on_receive = function(self, from, params)
        -- from: player ID who sent this
        -- params: { joker = "j_blueprint" }
        -- params are guaranteed to match the schema above

        local my_joker = get_random_joker()
        add_joker_to_hand(params.joker)

        if my_joker then
            remove_joker(my_joker)
            return { joker = my_joker.key }  -- send response back to sender
        else
            return true  -- acknowledge receipt, no response data
        end
    end,

    -- Default callback for when the sender gets a response.
    -- Used unless overridden on a specific action instance.
    on_response = function(self, response)
        if response and response.joker then
            add_joker_to_hand(response.joker)
        end
        remove_joker_by_key(self.params.joker)
    end,
})
```

#### Sending an Action

```lua
-- Uses the default on_response callback defined on the action type
lobby:action(my_mod.actions.swap_joker):send(target_player_id, { joker = "j_blueprint" })

-- Override the callback for a specific instance
local action = lobby:action(my_mod.actions.swap_joker)
action:callback(function(self, response)
    -- This runs instead of on_response for this instance only
    sendDebugMessage("Got response: " .. tostring(response and response.joker))
end)
action:send(target_player_id, { joker = "j_blueprint" })

-- Broadcast to all players in the lobby
lobby:action(my_mod.actions.swap_joker):broadcast({ joker = "j_blueprint" })
```

#### Simple Actions (No Response Needed)

Not every action needs request/response. For fire-and-forget events, skip `response_parameters` and `on_response`:

```lua
my_mod.actions.ready_blind = MPAPI.ActionType({
    key = "ready_blind",
    parameters = {
        { key = "blind", type = "string", required = true },
    },
    on_receive = function(self, from, params)
        mark_player_ready(from, params.blind)
        return true
    end,
})

-- Send it
lobby:action(my_mod.actions.ready_blind):send(host_id, { blind = "bl_small" })
```

### Events

Lifecycle events for the lobby.

```lua
lobby:on("connected", function()
    -- Lobby is ready. Safe to set metadata, subscribe, etc.
end)

lobby:on("player_joined", function(player_id)
    -- A new player connected to the lobby
end)

lobby:on("player_left", function(player_id)
    -- A player disconnected or was removed after grace period expired
end)

lobby:on("player_disconnected", function(player_id)
    -- A player's connection dropped unexpectedly (crash, internet, etc.)
    -- They have 2 minutes to reconnect before being removed
end)

lobby:on("player_reconnected", function(player_id)
    -- A disconnected player came back within the grace period
end)

lobby:on("metadata_changed", function(metadata)
    -- Host updated lobby metadata
end)

lobby:on("error", function(err)
    -- Something went wrong
end)

lobby:on("disconnected", function()
    -- Lost connection to the broker
end)
```

## Disconnect & Reconnect

When a player's connection drops unexpectedly (crash, internet outage, game close), they aren't removed immediately. Instead, the server starts a **2-minute grace period** that reserves their lobby slot.

- **During grace period** — other players receive `player_disconnected`. The player's slot is reserved and their state is preserved.
- **If they reconnect** — the player slots back in seamlessly. Other players receive `player_reconnected`. No data is lost.
- **If the timer expires** — the player is removed from the lobby with `player_left`. If the lobby is now empty, it closes.
- **Explicit leave** — calling `lobby:leave()` removes the player immediately with no grace period.

### Host Disconnect

When the host disconnects:
- Host role transfers immediately to the next available player (`host_changed` event)
- The disconnected host's lobby slot is still reserved during the grace period
- If they reconnect, they rejoin as a regular player (not host)

### Player Away Status

Players in a grace period are marked as "away" in the player list:

```lua
local players = lobby:get_players()
-- { { id = "player_123", state = {...}, is_away = false },
--   { id = "player_456", state = {...}, is_away = true } }
```

### State Recovery

Player state is published to MQTT retained topics (`lobby/{code}/players/{playerId}/state`), so it survives disconnects. When a player reconnects, they resubscribe to their own state topic and immediately receive their latest retained state.

Mod authors don't need to handle this manually. As long as game state is kept in player state via `lobby:set_player_state()`, it will be available on reconnect. The reconnecting client receives:

- Their own last published state (retained)
- Current lobby metadata (retained)
- A `player_reconnected` event confirming they're back

## Configuration

MultiplayerAPI is configured via SMODS mod config (`config.lua`), editable in-game from the mod's **Config** tab in the Mods menu or by editing the file directly:

```lua
return {
    ["chat_enabled"] = false,           -- enable/disable built-in lobby chat

    -- Self-hosted / local server (development). When use_custom_server is true, lobbies connect
    -- to custom_server_url instead of the official server. Use 127.0.0.1 (not "localhost") on
    -- Windows. custom_server_secure picks the scheme and ports automatically:
    --   secure -> API https on 8788, MQTT TLS on 8883
    --   plain  -> API http  on 8788, MQTT     on 1883
    -- The dev docker-compose API is plain HTTP, so use secure = false until the API serves TLS.
    ["use_custom_server"] = false,
    ["custom_server_url"] = "127.0.0.1",
    ["custom_server_secure"] = true,
}
```

The **Config** tab exposes "Use local / self-hosted server" and "Secure (TLS)" toggles plus an **Apply & Reconnect** button, so you can switch servers at runtime without a restart. Values are accessible at `SMODS.current_mod.config.*`. Explicit `MPAPI.connect{ api_url = ..., mqtt_broker = ..., mqtt_port = ..., mqtt_secure = ... }` opts still take precedence over the config.

Chat is handled entirely by MultiplayerAPI

## Architecture

MultiplayerAPI uses MQTT (a lightweight pub/sub messaging protocol) for networking, backed by an EMQX broker and a small Express API server.

```
Game Client <-> API Server (Express) <-> EMQX Broker -> PostgreSQL
```

- **Game client** calls the API server to create/join lobbies and receive broker credentials.
- **API server** manages lobby state, generates scoped MQTT credentials, and handles authentication. EMQX calls back to the API server on every connect and publish/subscribe to verify permissions.
- **EMQX broker** handles message routing. Knows nothing about lobbies or game logic and just asks the API server "is this allowed?" on every operation.
- **PostgreSQL** archives all messages via EMQX's rule engine for moderation and auditing. Not used during gameplay.

All networking runs on a dedicated `love.thread` so the game loop never blocks. The mod author doesn't interact with any of this directly.

### Permissions

The API server enforces access control via EMQX's HTTP authorization callbacks:

- **Lobby isolation** - Players can only publish/subscribe within their own lobby.
- **Host-only metadata** - Only the host can update lobby metadata and send lifecycle events.
- **Private player state** - Players can only read and write their own state topic. Other players' state is not accessible — use actions to share information.
- **Chat** - Players can only publish to their own chat topic. Identity is determined by the topic, not the payload, so players cannot impersonate each other.

These aren't conventions, they're enforced at the broker level. Unauthorized publishes are rejected before they reach any client.

### Future Authentication

The API server is the auth boundary. Currently it issues credentials directly. In the future, players will authenticate via **Steam** (session ticket validation) or **Discord** (OAuth2) before receiving broker credentials. The broker never touches third-party auth.
