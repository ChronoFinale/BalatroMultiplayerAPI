-- §22.2/§22.3: generic playback step-engine. Same pattern as ClaudeControl's
-- own Game:update hook + coroutine/queue machinery (lib/wait.lua's condition-
-- gated resume, lib/runner.lua's pop-one-item-at-a-time queue) -- borrowed as
-- the SHAPE, not the code: MPAPI must work standalone without ClaudeControl
-- installed, so this is a self-contained equivalent, not a dependency on it.
--
-- Walks a timeline (see timeline.lua) one action at a time, dispatching each
-- through MPAPI.playback.dispatch (registry.lua) -- driving real game actions
-- through the real engine, never a parallel fake-state renderer (matching
-- ClaudeControl's own state_dump.lua precedent: state is always re-derived by
-- driving real actions through real game logic). Waits for the previous
-- action's own event queue to drain before advancing, so playback paces
-- itself to real animation timing instead of instant-applying everything in
-- one frame.

-- actually removed from the queue), which would otherwise make playback
-- pacing look permanently stuck. Only `blocking` entries represent real
-- in-progress animation/scoring work -- confirmed live by snapshotting the
-- base queue mid-hand-play: every genuine gameplay event (chip/mult
-- animations, scoring, etc.) has blocking=true, while every persistent
-- housekeeping entry has blocking=false. So "busy" means "has a blocking
-- entry", not "queue is non-empty".
